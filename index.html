       <p>Chameleons or chamaeleons (family Chamaeleonidae)<img src="imagefolder/purplechm.jpg" alt="purple chameleon picture"/> are a distinctive and highly specialized clade of Old World lizards with 202 species described as of June 2015.[1] These species come in a range of colors, and many species have the ability to change color.

            Chameleons are distinguished by their zygodactylous feet; their very extensive, highly modified, rapidly extrudable tongues; their swaying gait;[2] and crests or horns on their brow and snout. Most species, the larger ones in particular, also have a prehensile tail. Chameleons' eyes are independently mobile, but in aiming at a prey item, they focus forward in coordination, affording the animal stereoscopic vision.
            
            Chameleons are adapted for climbing and visual hunting</p>
